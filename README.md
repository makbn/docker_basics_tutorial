# Kick-Start

### What is Docker?

- Docker by [Docker Official Website](https://www.docker.com/what-docker) :

  > Docker is the company driving the container movement and the only container **platform provider to address every application across the hybrid cloud.** Today’s businesses are under pressure to digitally transform but are constrained by existing applications and infrastructure while rationalizing an increasingly diverse portfolio of clouds, datacenters and application architectures. Docker enables true independence between applications and infrastructure and developers and IT ops to unlock their potential and creates a model for better collaboration and innovation.


- Docker by [Wikipedia]()

  > an open-source project that automates the deployment of software applications inside **containers**by providing an additional layer of abstraction and automation of **OS-level virtualization** on Linux.

- In summary:

  docker is an open-source project that use **OS-level virtualization technology** to provide an **isolated context** called **container** to **run application without overheads of virtual machines technology** that used tereditionally!

in few next paragraphs we will talk about virtualization technology!you can jump to Docker Hello World if you are not intrest!



# Virtualization history

### Pre-Virtualization World

day 0, you're alone, no virtual machines , no hypervisor hole damn resources are yours!

- **benefits**:

  - no overhead!
  - security
  - full and total access to its resources
  - performs an extremely high volume of read and/or write actions to the hard disk 

- **disadvantage**:

  - waste of money

  - waste of energy

  - waste of resource

  - no elasticity

  - no scalability

    ​

### Hypervisor-based Virtualization

i believe that God sent **hypervisors** to save our lives!in this method
